# Hospital Management System - Packet Tracer

## Description
The Hospital Management System is a network simulation project implemented using Packet Tracer. The system is designed to simulate the network infrastructure and services required for efficient management of a hospital's IT network.

With this project, the aim is to create a virtual network environment that models the various components and functionalities of a hospital's IT infrastructure, including:

- Network devices such as routers, switches, and servers
- Workstations and computers used by hospital staff
- Centralized server for data storage and management
- Network services like DHCP, DNS, and file sharing
- Security measures including firewalls and access control

The Hospital Management System project in Packet Tracer provides a practical and hands-on approach to understanding the network requirements of a hospital environment. It allows users to explore the network setup, configuration, and troubleshooting aspects of a hospital's IT infrastructure.

## Features
- Simulation of a hospital's IT network infrastructure
- Modeling of network devices including routers, switches, and servers
- Provision of workstations for hospital staff
- Implementation of network services such as DHCP, DNS, and file sharing
- Integration of security measures like firewalls and access control

## Requirements
- Packet Tracer software
- Computer with sufficient resources to run Packet Tracer smoothly

## Usage
1. Install and launch Packet Tracer on your computer.
2. Open the Hospital Management System project file.
3. Explore the network layout and configuration of various devices.
4. Interact with the network by performing tasks such as configuring devices, managing workstations, and testing network services.
5. Experiment with different scenarios and configurations to gain a better understanding of the hospital network management.
